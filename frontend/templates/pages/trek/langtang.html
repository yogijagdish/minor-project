Langtang valley, located 61.8 km away from Kathmandu, amazes travelers with its mountain streams and stunning views. Mount Langtang Lirung (7246m) surrounds the rhododendron and pine forests that beautifies the valley. The warm hospitality and vibrant culture in the Langtang valley makes you feel like you are at home. The Langtang trek starts from Syabrubesi (1460m) and reaches the highest point at Kang Jing Gompa at an altitude of 3900m. You can also opt to trek Kang Jing Ri, a day from Kang Jing Gompa, to see the mesmerizing 360-degree views of the Himalayas. The trek offers a route that ascends and descends at several places with spectacular views of landscapes, painted chortens, Buddhist prayers flags and much more.
During the trek, you can see the remains of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. And see how the locals have restored back the trekking trails and the Langtang valley. This village is where you will see the live example of the rebuilding of the nation after the biggest tragedy.
Langtang Valley Trek offers a majestic view of mountains with panoramic landscapes. It is the top 3 most visited trekking destinations in Nepal alongside Everest Base Camp Trek and Annapurna Base Camp Trek. Basically, this trek is exciting with picturesque views of the beautiful village that lies within the Langtang National Park. Langtang is the best vacation spot for regular and novice trekkers, and I am sure it will be your unforgettable lifetime experience.

<h2>How fit I should be?</h2>
This trek doesn´t require super fitness but however moderate level of fitness is necessary though there is no direct climbing involved. You will need to trek over some rocky section near high camp and base camp. Guide in Himalaya (Wilderness Excursion - our corporate sister agency) advises our clients going trekking to see a doctor before they go for a check-up and to talk about dealing with altitude sickness. For pure trekking along the Mardi Himal trek in Nepal you´ll need to consider the amount of days you´ll be out trekking to get an idea of how fit you should be. Most days include 4-7 hours of slow hiking. If you plan to do the trek in 4-5 days (which you can),<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
Lamtang Trek cost depends on the mode of tour, accommodation and transportation. The price here we have offered is USD 379.00 per person inclusive is standard trek price on double occupancy basis. Single supplement charge USD 85.00 for solo clients. The price will be according to budget, standard and deluxe tour plan and group sizes. Taking flights to and from Pokhara saves your time and comfortable rather than taking tiring long bus ride though riding bus reduces the trip cost. Accommodation in Kathmandu will be extra or we leave you a choice to book on your own. We can arrange your transfers to and from Pokhara and accommodation in Pokhara if you ask us. And there will be neat and clean simple trekking lodge accommodation on twin sharing basis during the trek.<h2>Threat and Risk</h2>
Participants should be aware trekking, mountaineering and travelling in a developing country are activities that involve a risk of personal injury or death. As a condition of booking you must accept these risks and be responsible for your own actions and involvement. Adventure travel requires an open and flexible attitude. You may experience extreme conditions, unpredictable weather and last minute changes to the itinerary beyond our control. The ability to work in team is an important aspect of all of our trips. However your Guide in Himalaya tries best to maximize your trip is great fun and lifetime experience. </p></div>
