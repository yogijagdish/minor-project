<div class="mhead"><p><h2>TRIP OVERVIEW</h2>
Fantastic Mardi Himal Trek is located just east of one of the most legendary trekking destination of Nepal, the Annapurna Base Camp trek. 
Mardi Himal trek is an unseen gem yet. Few trekkers make their way to the Mardi Himal Base Camp outstandingly positioned at the base of 
Mardi Himal and the Annapurna region´s most iconic mount Machapuchhre literally meaning "Fish tail". The trail goes along small winding 
paths, through enchanted rhododendron forests until you climb out of the forest at an elevation around 3,300 meter. The landscape changes 
quite abruptly into a rugged high mountain landscape, with amazing views of Mardi Himal, Machapuchre, Annapurna South and Hiunchuli.



From High Camp (3700m; some maps incorrectly mention 3900 m) you can climb up to Mardi Himal Base Camp in about 3-4 hours, which offers 
spectacular close up views of the entire Annapurna Range. There are simple guesthouses and homestays along the entire route. If you plan 
to do this trek in the winter months please check with a us Wilderness Excursion – Kathmandu based registered adventure trekking company 
operated by enthusiastic trekking pioneers.</p></div>

<h2>When to trek?</h2>
Mid Sept-October – November is Autumn Season: this is Nepal´s peak and best time to go trekking. March – May is the second best 
season of year to go trekking. December – January -February: the skies are clear but it can get very cold and there is a risk of 
passes being closed due to snow fall.



May - June: This is Nepal´s hot pre-monsoon season and it can get very warm indeed. The valleys however are starting to bloom 
with flowers though green leaves come up, still a good time to trek.



June - Mid September: this is Monsoon season and the least popular time to go trekking in Nepal. The risk of leeches, downpours
 increases greatly. Due to the early forested areas leeches at this time of year in Mardi Himal are quite active! Wear long trekking 
 trousers tucked in at this time of year. And leech/mosquito repellent spray is recommended to carry with.



<h2>Getting there and away</h2>
Like most of the Annapurna treks except Annapurna Circuit, Mardi Himal Trek also starts and ends in Pokhara - second biggest c
ity and naturally blessed place to relax after the big hikes in Annapurna. It is 200km to west from Kathmandu. All domestic 
airlines run several flights daily from Kathmandu which cost USD 110 - 125.00 per person. And about 7-8 hours drive by tourist 
bus (Cost USD 10 - 25). Local buses leave every one hour from Kathmandu till 3pm. Green Line Buses (USD 25.00 per person) and 
other tourist buses lives every morning at 7:00AM. A private car can be arranged if you ask. Wilderness Excursion can arrange 
and handles everything on your request.



<h2>Itinerary</h2>
Mardi Himal Trek Itinerary will be 5 to 7 days from/to Pokhara and 1 to 2 days transportation day from/to Kathmandu depending on
 time you have and level of your physical fitness. This trek can be combined with other related treks to Annapurna; many people 
 combine this trek with Ghandruk trek, Panchase Trek, Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek etc. Our carefully designed 8 days itinerary is 
 standard that suits to all average trekkers. Taking domestic flights to Pokhara from Kathmandu and start the trek on same day 
 shortens the trip as flights save your time. We also offer tailor-made Mardi Himal Trek so please send us your detail and requirements.



<h2>How fit I should be?</h2>
This trek doesn´t require super fitness but however moderate level of fitness is necessary though there is no direct climbing 
involved. You will need to trek over some rocky section near high camp and base camp. Guide in Himalaya (Wilderness Excursion 
- our corporate sister agency) advises our clients going trekking to see a doctor before they go for a check-up and to talk about
 dealing with altitude sickness. For pure trekking along the Mardi Himal trek in Nepal you´ll need to consider the amount of days 
 you´ll be out trekking to get an idea of how fit you should be. Most days include 4-7 hours of slow hiking. If you plan to do the
  trek in 4-5 days (which you can),



<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
Mardi Himal Trek cost depends on the mode of tour, accommodation and transportation. The price here we have offered is USD 379.00 
per person inclusive is standard trek price on double occupancy basis. Single supplement charge USD 85.00 for solo clients. The
 price will be according to budget, standard and deluxe tour plan and group sizes. Taking flights to and from Pokhara saves your 
 time and comfortable rather than taking tiring long bus ride though riding bus reduces the trip cost. Accommodation in Kathmandu 
 will be extra or we leave you a choice to book on your own. We can arrange your transfers to and from Pokhara and accommodation in 
 Pokhara if you ask us. And there will be neat and clean simple trekking lodge accommodation on twin sharing basis during the trek.



<h2>Threat and Risk</h2>
Participants should be aware trekking, mountaineering and travelling in a developing country are activities that involve a risk of 
personal injury or death. As a condition of booking you must accept these risks and be responsible for your own actions and involvement.
 Adventure travel requires an open and flexible attitude. You may experience extreme conditions, unpredictable weather and last minute 
 changes to the itinerary beyond our control. The ability to work in team is an important aspect of all of our trips. However your Guide 
 in Himalaya tries best to maximize your trip is great fun and lifetime experience. </p>
